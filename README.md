# GW-freeze-in

This repository contains calculations related to gravitational wave-induced freeze-in of Weyl fermions, developed in [arXiv:2405.09723](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09723) and [arXiv:2406.01534](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01534) by Azadeh Maleknejad and Joachim Kopp. This includes in particular a Jupyter notebook that reproduces the parameter space plots in the mass-vs.-temperature plane and a Mathematica notebook reproducing some of the analytic calculations in the papers.
